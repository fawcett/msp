We'll be meeting **Wednesday, September 30th** at the **Walker Library** in the Calhoun Room from **6:00 - 8:00 pm** in Minneapolis, and focus on **typography and cartography**. Kat Cantner will show us which fonts to use in particular situations, with tricks to make a map "pop"!  We will also have Marty Elmer, who will talk about Project Linework, a collection of handcrafted cartographic linework sets, each with their own aesthetic, all released to the  Public Domain.  

After our presentations, we'll have a work/networking session focused on one last ditch effort to contribute to the [NACIS map](http://maptimemsp.github.io/nacis2015-map) next month!

We’ll have pizza and refreshments, courtesy of CartoDB. As always, beginners are welcome and don’t forget to bring a laptop.
