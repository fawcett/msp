To start off the fall season we'll be meeting at the **Walker Library** in the Calhoun Room in Minneapolis from **6:00 - 8:00 pm**! We'll focus on **typography and cartography** with presentations from Kat Cantner and Marty Elmer.

After our presentations, we'll have a work/networking session focused on one last ditch effort to contribute to the [NACIS map](http://maptimemsp.github.io/nacis2015-map) next month!

We’ll have pizza and refreshments, courtesy of CartoDB. As always, beginners are welcome and don’t forget to bring a laptop.
