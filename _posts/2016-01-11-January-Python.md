Enjoy live music and homemade cookies, network, ride the train, and share your love of all things map!

Kick off the New Year in style… Maptime style! We’ll be meeting at the **Department of Revenue's Stassen Building** in **St. Paul** over the lunch hour to accommodate our members who have trouble making it to evening events. The Stassen Building is on the green line, across the street from the [Robert Street Station](http://www.metrotransit.org/robert-street-station). Check out the [Department of Revenue's website](http://www.revenue.state.mn.us/about_us/Pages/directions.aspx) for more detailed driving directions and parking information.

January's session is all about **Python**! The programming language Python has been around for over a quarter century and in that time has amassed users and enthusiasts from all industries, including of course, GIS. Python’s popularity comes from its simplicity, speed and flexibility. Users benefit from the automation of geoprocessing and data management tasks. This automation makes repetitive processes easier, faster, and more accurate.

Python users, ranging from beginner to advanced, will discuss how they got started with Python, challenges faced and overcome, and challenges still looming.

After the presentations, we’ll have time for discussions, sharing of projects, and anything else that comes up. As always, **beginners are welcome, and don’t forget to bring a laptop!**
