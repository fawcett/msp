We'll be back at **CoCo Coworking - Uptown** in Minneapolis and back to our normal hours **6:00 - 8:00 p.m.** on **Wednesday, August 19th**.

August's meeting will feature a **Collaborative Work Session** focused on the [2015 NACIS Map](http://maptimemsp.github.io/nacis2015-map). We'll work through Git, GitHub, and work together to add more points of interest to the map! In addition to working on the NACIS map, we welcome you to bring along any of your projects to showcase to other Maptime attendees, ask questions, and get feedback from others! 

We'll have pizza and refreshments, courtesy of CartoDB. As always, beginners are welcome and don't forget to bring a laptop.
